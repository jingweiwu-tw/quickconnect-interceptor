=======================

An OkHttp application interceptor for Synology Quick Connect

What is OkHttp application interceptor?
---------------------------------------

A powerful tool introduced by [OkHttp][okhttp]. We use it to resolve real IP address before sending request to Synology NAS server, detailed information can be found [here][interceptor].


What is Synology Quick Connect?
-------------------------------

[Synology Inc. (Chinese: 群暉科技)][synology] is a Taiwanese corporation that specializes in network attached storage (NAS) appliances.
QuickConnect is designed to make connecting Synology NAS servers easy and quick, even NAS is behind NAT. You can find the white paper [here][quickconnect].


How to use
----------

- Add jar in buid.gradle
```groovy
compile project (':QuickConnectInterceptor')
```

- Add QuickConnectInterceptor when creating OkHttpClient
```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(new QuickConnectInterceptor())
    .build();
```

- Send a request to Synology NAS server. 
To use QuickConnect, you need to have a QuickConnect ID. To compose a HTTP request, replace hostname with QuickConnect ID.
For example, if your QuickConnect ID is "**dsm**" and want to send a pingpong request(webman/pingpong.cgi?action=cors), the request should be looked like:
```java
String QuickconnectId = "dsm";
HttpUrl httpUrl = HttpUrl.parse("http://" + QuickconnectId +"/webman/pingpong.cgi?action=cors");
Request request = new Request.Builder().url(httpUrl).build();
client.newCall(request).execute();
```
